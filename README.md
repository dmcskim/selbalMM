# Selecting Balances with Mixed Models

`selbalMM` is a Python extension to the `selbal` R package. `selbalMM` implements a forward-selection method for identifying groups of taxa whose relative abundance, or balance, is associated with a continuous variable of interest. `selbalMM` uses a mixed model approach, allowing for longitudinal and clustered data.
